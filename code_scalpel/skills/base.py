"""Skill ABC — pluggable per-stack contract for test / lint / format.

A Skill is a small piece of project-specific knowledge: "tests run with
pytest -x", "lint with ruff", "format with ruff format", "build with
docker compose". The agent (and TUI views) ask the registry for the
active skill rather than hardcoding shell commands; this is what lets
the same `run_tests` tool work for a Python project today and a Go one
tomorrow.

The class is deliberately tiny — a Skill is just three commands plus a
detector. Anything richer (env vars, working dir, multi-stage builds)
goes into a future subclass or a future field; today we just want the
hardcoded `pytest` call in `_tool_run_tests` to become `default_skill.
test_cmd()`.

Design notes:

* `format_cmd` returns `None` (not `[]`) when the skill has no formatter
  — empty list would be ambiguous with "run something with no args".
* `test_cmd` and `lint_cmd` always return a list; a skill that genuinely
  has no test runner shouldn't subclass `Skill` in the first place
  (compose-style skills like Docker still return *something*, even if
  it's `docker compose run app pytest`).
* `token_cost` is a rough char-count divided by 4 — same ratio used in
  session accounting. Real cost depends on how the model is prompted
  with the skill metadata, but for /skills accounting this is enough.
